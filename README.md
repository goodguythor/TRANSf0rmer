# Transformer from Scratch with Numpy
## Setup
### Clone repository
Clone this repository to your device and open the project on your favorite IDE.
### Create python virtual environment
Create your own python virtual environment to avoid dependencies hell and always move on it before you run any cell in ```transformer.ipynb```. If you name your venv other than ```transformer```, please consider changing the value on the ```.gitignore``` file to your venv name to avoid pushing your venv script if you want to fork the repo.
## How to run
Just run every cell on file ```transformer.ipynb```, make sure you're using your virtual environment for your active kernel!
